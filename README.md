## Code Functionality

GPandas is designed to provide a familiar and efficient way to work with tabular data in Go. Key functionalities include:

### Core DataFrame Operations

- **DataFrame Creation**: Construct columnar DataFrames from in-memory data using `gpandas.DataFrame()`, or load from external sources like CSV files using `gpandas.Read_csv()`. Each DataFrame uses a `map[string]*Series` structure for efficient columnar access.
- **Column Manipulation**:
    - **Renaming**: Easily rename columns using `DataFrame.Rename()` while preserving column order.
- **Data Merging**: Combine DataFrames based on common columns with `DataFrame.Merge()`, supporting:
    - **Inner Join (`InnerMerge`)**: Keep only matching rows from both DataFrames.
    - **Left Join (`LeftMerge`)**: Keep all rows from the left DataFrame, and matching rows from the right.
    - **Right Join (`RightMerge`)**: Keep all rows from the right DataFrame, and matching rows from the left.
    - **Full Outer Join (`FullMerge`)**: Keep all rows from both DataFrames, filling in missing values with `nil`.
- **Data Export**:
    - **CSV Export**:  Export DataFrames to CSV format using `DataFrame.ToCSV()`, with options for:
        - Custom separators.
        - Writing to a file path or returning a CSV string.
- **Data Display**:
    - **Pretty Printing**:  Generate formatted, human-readable table representations of DataFrames using `DataFrame.String()`.

### Data Loading from External Sources

- **CSV Reading**: Efficiently read CSV files into DataFrames with `gpandas.Read_csv()`, leveraging concurrent processing for performance.
- **SQL Database Integration**:
    - **`Read_sql()`**: Query and load data from SQL databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and others supported by Go database/sql package) into DataFrames.
- **Google BigQuery Support**:
    - **`From_gbq()`**: Query and load data from Google BigQuery tables into DataFrames, enabling analysis of large datasets stored in BigQuery.

### Data Types

GPandas provides strong type support through its columnar architecture:

- **`Series`**: The fundamental column type that enforces homogeneous data types within each column. Each Series maintains a `dtype` and provides type-safe access methods.
- **`FloatCol`**: For `float64` columns (legacy type for DataFrame construction).
- **`StringCol`**: For `string` columns (legacy type for DataFrame construction).
- **`IntCol`**: For `int64` columns (legacy type for DataFrame construction).
- **`BoolCol`**: For `bool` columns (legacy type for DataFrame construction).
- **`Column`**: Generic column type to hold `any` type values when specific type constraints are not needed.
- **`TypeColumn[T comparable]`**: Generic column type for columns of any comparable type `T`.

GPandas ensures type safety through Series-level dtype enforcement, preventing type mismatches and ensuring data integrity across all operations.

### Performance Features

GPandas is built with performance in mind, incorporating several features for efficiency:

- **Columnar Storage**: Uses a columnar DataFrame structure (`map[string]*Series`) for efficient column-wise operations and memory layout, similar to modern analytical databases.
- **Concurrent CSV Reading**: Utilizes worker pools and buffered channels for parallel CSV parsing, significantly speeding up CSV loading, especially for large files.
- **Efficient Data Structures**:  Uses Go's native data structures and generics to minimize overhead and maximize performance.
- **Series-level Thread Safety**:  Provides thread-safe operations at the Series level using RWMutex, ensuring data consistency in concurrent environments while allowing concurrent reads.
- **Optimized Memory Management**: Designed for efficient memory usage with columnar storage to handle large datasets effectively.
- **Buffered Channels**: Employs buffered channels for data processing pipelines to improve throughput and reduce blocking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

GPandas requires **Go version 1.18 or above** due to its use of generics.

### Installation

Install GPandas using `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/apoplexi24/gpandas
```

## Core Components

### DataFrame

The central data structure in GPandas, the `DataFrame`, is designed for handling two-dimensional, labeled data using a columnar architecture. It consists of a `map[string]*Series` for column storage and a `ColumnOrder []string` for maintaining column sequence. This design provides methods for data manipulation, analysis, and I/O operations, similar to pandas DataFrames in Python but with improved performance characteristics.

### Series

The `utils/collection/series.go` provides a concurrency-safe `Series` type that serves as the fundamental building block for DataFrame columns. Each Series enforces homogeneous data types and provides efficient access methods like `At()`, `Set()`, `Append()`, and `Len()`.

### Set

The `utils/collection/set.go` provides a generic `Set` implementation, useful for various set operations. While not directly exposed as a primary user-facing component, it's an important utility within GPandas for efficient data management and algorithm implementations.

## Performance

GPandas is engineered for performance through:

- **Columnar Architecture**: The `map[string]*Series` structure enables efficient column-wise operations and better memory locality, similar to modern analytical databases.
- **Generics**: Leveraging Go generics to avoid runtime type assertions and interface overhead, leading to faster execution.
- **Efficient Memory Usage**:  Designed to minimize memory allocations and copies with columnar storage for better performance when dealing with large datasets.
- **Concurrency**: Utilizing Go's concurrency features, such as goroutines and channels, to parallelize operations like CSV reading and potentially other data processing tasks in the future.
- **Series-level Optimization**: Each Series maintains its own type information and provides optimized access patterns for columnar data.
- **Zero-copy Operations**:  Aiming for zero-copy operations wherever feasible to reduce overhead and improve speed.
